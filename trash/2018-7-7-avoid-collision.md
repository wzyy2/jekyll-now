[Active safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_safety)

    In the automotive sector the term active safety (or primary safety) refers to safety systems that are active prior to an accident. This has traditionally referred to non-complex systems such as good visibility from the vehicle and low interior noise levels. Nowadays, however, this area contains highly advanced systems such as anti-lock braking system, electronic stability control and collision warning/avoidance through automatic braking. This compares with passive safety (or secondary safety), which are active during an accident. To this category belong seat belts, deformation zones and air-bags, etc.

    Advancement in passive safety systems has progressed very far over the years, and the automotive industry has shifted its attention to active safety where there are still a lot of new unexplored areas. Research today focuses primarily on collision avoidance (with other vehicles, pedestrians and wild animals)[1] and vehicle platooning.

常见的主动安全系统，有下面几种分类。

#### ABS/EBD/ESP
底盘上的防滑部分，主要是机械装置+程控的配合，防止车辆在一些情况下的失控，保证车辆的稳定性。

#### 车道偏离/环视/并道辅助
辅助驾驶系统，主要是
